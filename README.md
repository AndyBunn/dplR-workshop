# dplR-workshop
This is a set of rough notes for doing workshops with `dplR`. I occasionally think I'll take the time to write up a dendro analysis in R book and then I remember that I have 1,000 other things to do that would be more fun and less aggravating. So these notes will remain rough for the time being. All this material is published using bookdown here:
