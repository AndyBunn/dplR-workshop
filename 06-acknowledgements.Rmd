# Acknowledgements
Although I started making `dplR` in 2006 or so. But it would look nothing like it does today without the contributions of many collaborators over the years. I would especially like to thank Mikko Korpela. I have never met Mikko in person but he spent countless hours (but into the thousands I think) converting my ugly R code into severals 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
auths <- httr::content(httr::GET("http://crandb.r-pkg.org/dplR"))$Author
auths <- gsub(pattern = "aut",replacement = "Author",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "cph",replacement = "Copyright holder",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "cre",replacement = "Creator",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "trl",replacement = "Translator to R",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "ctb",replacement = "Contributor",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = " \\[",replacement = ":",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "\\],",replacement = "",x=auths)
auths <- gsub(pattern = "\\]",replacement = "",x=auths)
auths2 <- read.table(text=auths,sep = "\n")
auths2 <- tidyr::separate(auths2,col = 1, sep = ":", into = c("Person", "Role(s)"))
auths2
```
